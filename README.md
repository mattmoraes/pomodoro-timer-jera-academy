# pomodoro-timer-jera-academy
This is a project of a timer that uses Pomodoro Technique, made for Jera Academy by Mateus Moraes (me).
According to the official website of Pomodoro's Technique creator, Francesco Cirillo, the technique consists, basically, of 6 steps:
 1 - Choose a task you'd like to get done;
 2 - Set the time for 25 minutes;
 3 - Work on the task until the timer rings;
 4 - When the timer rings, put a checkmark on a paper;
 5 - Take a short break (around 5 minutes);
 6 - After 4 short breaks, take a longer break (20-30 minutes).
In this project, I'm developing my own pomodoro timer to help people use the pomodoro technique.
On the development, I used HTML, CSS and Javascript.
